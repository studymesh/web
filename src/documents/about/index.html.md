StudyMesh was created by Avi Deitcher to ease collaborative learning.

In the summer of 2009, a great teacher, [Rabbi Yehuda Amital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Amital), passed away. He had thousands of students from decades of teaching all over the world, Tokyo to Tel Aviv, Montreal to Melbourne, Los Angeles to London. These students wanted to honour his memory by studying together, but had no easy way to collaborate worldwide.

Avi dreamed that he could make it happen, and built a simple, easy-to-use Web application for collaborative study in under two weeks. Well over 1,000 people signed up in the next two weeks and studied together.

In the years since, many people, both those who had participated and those who had heard of it, approached Avi and asked him to provide an application that could be used for any person, not just this teacher, and for any purpose of collaborative study.

StudyMesh was born.

You, too, can set up your own collaborative Study for any purpose at all. Just take the first step and [sign up for free](../../loginregister/register).
