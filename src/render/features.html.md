## Awesome Features!

StudyMesh has the most amazing features. You will wonder how you collaborated before!

#### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil red"></span> Self-Registration

Everyone signs up and controls their own commitments. They can register for any part of your study, and they can cancel their registration at any time. 

Of course, you, Mr. or Ms. Study Owner, can override any reservations in your study, cancel them or even mark them as complete!

#### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check green"></span> Track Completion

Everyone who signs up can mark their commitment as complete! Yes, once they are done, they simply click the "Complete" button and it is done.

#### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-dashboard green"></span> Reports 

You, the Study Owner, can report everyone who registered, including their names, city and country, what they reserved, and if it was completed. Easily find:

* All reservations
* All users who made reservations
* Study units not yet reserved
* Reservations not yet completed

Prefer to do it on your own? No problem, just export them to Excel with a single click.

#### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope blue"></span> Email Notifications (coming soon)

StudyMesh knows people are busy. We want to help you to get that study done!

* Automatically send out email reminders to those who have reservations, reminding them to complete before the finish date. 
* Get daily email summaries of who signed up, how many are taken, how many are left.
* Register and reset password via email.

#### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> Mobile App (coming soon) 

Want to manage it all from your iPhone or Android? So do we! Mobile apps are on the way, so pay close attention!
