## Plans & Pricing
#### Is this really free?
Yes, it really is free... mostly. 

1. Registration is *always* free.
2. Participating in a study is *always* free.
3. Creating a study is free *for now*.

For these activities we **don't even want your payment info.**

#### So what does cost?
For now, nothing. Period.

In the future, we probably will charge a fee for some activities. It will be one of:

* A charge for each study; or
* A monthly fee for a number of studies; or
* Study for free, but a charge if you want others to be able to sign up, or how long a study can last.

We will also offer additional services, such as SMS notifications, scheduling and special reporting, which may be included in premium studies only.

However, we **will not** charge for studies already created. We like getting our services from clean and transparent places that are open to us and don't change things after we start, so we strive to provide the same to you.

If you have input as to what services are valuable to you, we would love to [hear about it from you](mailto:help@studymesh.com).

#### Do you have mobile apps?
We are working on it; stay tuned.
